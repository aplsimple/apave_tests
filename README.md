# apave's tests

This is a batch of tests for [apave](https://chiselapp.com/user/aplsimple/repository/pave/download) package.

Also, one of these tests (*test2_pave.tcl*) can test some themes of [ale_themes](https://chiselapp.com/user/aplsimple/repository/ale_themes/download) package.

    |
    |__apave
    |  |__ ...
    |
    |__ale_themes
    |  |__ ...
    |
    ...
